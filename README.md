## Hypothesis
The runtime for the best case and the average case is O(nlogn), while the runtime for the worst case O(n^2).

## Background
We were first introduced the partition method that the QuickSort method. We established that the partition method organizes all the elements less than the element at the pivot position to the left of it and all the elements greater than the element at the pivot position to the right of it. We then first used partition in a method that finds the yth smallest value in an array as fast as possible. The idea then came upon our class that we could use the partition method to sort an array of integers. We were also told to identify the runtimes of the average case, best case, and worst case, and with this lab we were told to prove it.
